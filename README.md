# Tab Stasher
This extension of vscode allows you to persist or restore all opened tabs on switching branches.

## Features
Tab Stasher allows you restore the state of all opened tabs in Visual Studio Code when you switch between Git branches. This helps you to quickly resume your work where you left off when you switch back to a previous branch.

###### Note: When you switch branches, extension will close all files in current branch and open all the files that were previously saved in the previous branch or the branch you are trying to switch to.
